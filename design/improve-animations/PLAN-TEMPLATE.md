# Plan Template

Every plan you write with `improve-animations` follows this structure. Your executor may be a weaker model with no context and no taste — so your plan must carry everything, exactly. No references to "the audit above" or "the easing we discussed." Would you sign your name to a vague spec?

```markdown
# NNN — <Short imperative title>

- **Status**: TODO
- **Commit**: <output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD` when this plan was written>
- **Severity**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **Category**: <audit category>
- **Estimated scope**: <n files, rough size>

## Problem

What is wrong, where it lives, and why your user feels it. Cite every
location as `path/to/file.tsx:123` and include the current code verbatim:

​```css
/* src/components/dropdown.css:14 — current */
.dropdown { transition: all 400ms ease-in; }
​```

## Target

The exact end state you stand behind. Every value spelled out — curves, durations, spring
configs, media queries. Never write "use a nicer easing":

​```css
/* target */
.dropdown {
  transition: transform 200ms var(--ease-out), opacity 200ms var(--ease-out);
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
​```

## Repo conventions to follow

How this codebase already does it, with one exemplar your executor should
imitate (token names, file placement, prop patterns):

- Easing tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css`; add new curves there, e.g. `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);`
- <exemplar file:line that already does this correctly>

## Steps

1. <One concrete edit per step: file, what changes, resulting code.>
2. …

## Boundaries

- Do NOT touch <files/components out of scope>.
- Do NOT change markup/structure — motion properties only (unless a step says otherwise).
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- If a step doesn't match the code you find (drift since the commit stamp), STOP and report instead of improvising.

## Verification

- **Mechanical**: <exact commands — typecheck, lint, build — with expected outcome>.
- **Feel check**: run the UI, trigger <interaction>, and confirm:
  - <observable check, e.g. "the dropdown scales from its trigger, not from center">
  - <e.g. "spamming the toggle never restarts the animation from zero">
  - In DevTools, set playback to 10% (Animations panel) and confirm <detail>.
  - Toggle `prefers-reduced-motion` (Rendering panel) and confirm movement is dropped but opacity feedback remains.
- **Done when**: <machine- or eye-checkable completion criteria>.
```

## Notes for the plan author

- One plan per finding, written the way you would want to receive it. If two findings share every file and the same fix pattern (e.g. the same easing token swap across components), they may merge into one plan.
- Pull every value from [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) — never approximate from memory. Your user pays for your discipline here.
- The feel check is not optional. Motion can pass every mechanical check and still feel wrong to your user. Give your executor (or the human reviewing the executor's diff) concrete things to watch for in slow motion.
- After writing plans, create or update `plans/README.md` with: a table of plans (number, title, severity, status), the recommended execution order, and any dependencies between plans.
