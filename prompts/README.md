# prompts/ index

Paste-in task prompts. Not installable skills (see `../skills/`).

| Folder | Role | Pair with |
|---|---|---|
| **`reviews/`** | Audits, security, performance, production go/no-go, Tauri QC, documentation | Always `../skills/review/audit/SKILL.md` first |
| **`scaffolds/`** | Greenfield product builds + README voice templates | Matching `../languages/*` / `../frameworks/*` |
| **`domains/`** | Extension point. Add `domains/<your-stack>/` for threat models that only apply to one platform. Do not mirror generic Security/Error/Perf files that already live in `reviews/`. | Always `../skills/review/audit/SKILL.md` first |
| **`workflow/`** | How the agent should behave before and during a task, independent of stack | Any prompt above |

## Rules

1. **One prompt per task.** Do not paste the whole tree.
2. **Reviews default to report-only** until the human sets scope and mode `fix`.
3. **Scaffolds** implement only what was asked; prefer extending an existing repo.
4. **Paths** in these files assume this pack layout (or the same layout under project `docs/`).
